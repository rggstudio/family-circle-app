# Family Circle - Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

Family Circle is a mobile app designed to help families stay connected through a single, organized platform. It allows family members to share posts, schedule events, chat directly, and manage tasks together. The app tackles the common problem of family disconnection by bringing together various communication and organization tools, ensuring all members—from children to adults—can interact and coordinate easily.

The app is being built to simplify family communication and management while offering a fun, engaging, and secure environment. Key objectives include secure user authentication, comprehensive user management (with distinct admin versus general user roles), interactive family feeds, event-based chats, and built-in monetization options. Success will be measured by high user engagement, smooth real-time interactions, and an enriching, seamless experience across iOS and Android platforms.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   User onboarding including sign-up, login, and password-reset flows using Auth Clerk (email/password and Google).
*   Different user roles: Family Circle Admin (who can manage invites, approve join requests, and assign tasks) and general User.
*   Mobile-only support for iOS and Android using Expo.
*   A dynamic dashboard for both Admins and Users to view family updates, messages, and notifications.
*   Family Feed displaying posts with media (photos, videos) along with likes and comments.
*   Calendar integration for family events with event-specific chat (supporting both text and attachments).
*   Direct messaging with end-to-end encrypted conversations and group chats.
*   Media sharing with file limits (5 MB photos, 50 MB videos) and integration with Cloudinary.
*   Task management for shared to-do lists and family goals.
*   Family Directory displaying contact details and optional real-time location sharing.
*   Push notifications through Firebase Cloud Messaging.
*   Payment processing using Stripe for subscription models, in-app purchases, and monetization options.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   A web version of the app; the focus is solely on mobile platforms.
*   Extensive third-party integrations beyond Google Calendar, Google Contacts, and Cloudinary for the initial launch.
*   Advanced customization features beyond the provided design guidelines and basic customization options.
*   Enterprise-level reporting or analytics dashboards for family management.
*   Future features like merchandise sales or a detailed referral program will be left for later phases.

## 3. User Flow

A new user begins by landing on the family-friendly welcome page where they are presented with options to sign up or log in. If signing up, they will create a Family Circle through a straightforward registration that includes entering an email/password, and whether you are creating a Family Circle or you are joining a Family Circle with an invite code supported by Auth Clerk. After registration, the user is guided to a profile setup page where they can add their name, profile photo, birthday, and other personal details. If joining an existing family circle, the user enters an invite code on the registration process or scans a QR code provided by the Family Circle Admin that will prefill in the invite code on the registration page.

Once logged in, users see a personalized dashboard that acts as a central hub. Here, they can view recent family posts, schedule and view events on the family calendar, and manage tasks in their shared to-do list. The family feed, messaging screens, and real-time updates through push notifications ensure that users remain connected. Family Circle Admins have additional tools visible on their dashboard, such as managing invites, pairing adult/child accounts, and handling permissions for task assignments.

*   **User Roles & Permissions:**

    *   The roles (Family Circle Admin and User) and their associated functionalities are clearly defined, with the admin role handling specific tasks like pairing and managing invites.

*   **Design Consistency:**

    *   The project will strictly follow the provided color palette and gradient guidelines to ensure a consistent and appealing user interface.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Real-Time Data Management:**

    *   Handling real-time chat, notifications, and feed updates using Firebase may present challenges in terms of synchronization and data consistency. Continuous monitoring and scaling the Firebase instance will be necessary.

*   **Third-Party API Limitations:**

    *   Rate limits or downtime from services like Google Calendar API, Cloudinary, or Stripe can affect functionality. Implementing proper retries and fallback mechanisms is recommended.

*   **Authentication Security:**

    *   While using Auth Clerk simplifies authentication, ensuring that password resets and account recovery processes are secure and user-friendly requires careful implementation.

*   **Media Upload Performance:**

    *   Managing file uploads and ensuring consistent performance with file size limitations might need careful handling on slower networks. Leveraging Cloudinary's optimization features will mitigate some issues.

*   **Platform-Specific Issues:**

    *   Consistency across iOS and Android might be challenging. Extensive testing and platform-specific adjustments will be required to ensure a uniform experience.

*   **Push Notification Reliability:**

    *   Ensuring notifications respect user settings and time zones could introduce complexities; testing across various scenarios is vital to avoid user disturbances during off-hours.
