# Backend Structure Document

This document outlines the backend architecture, hosting solutions, and infrastructure components for the Family Circle app. The aim is to provide a clear, step-by-step explanation of how the backend is built, how data is managed, and how various services are integrated to ensure reliable performance and security.

## Backend Architecture

*   **Design Overview:**

    *   The backend is built using Node.js, providing RESTful APIs to handle business logic and data transactions.
    *   Firebase is used as both a real-time database and for authentication. This combination ensures immediate data updates and secure access.
    *   The architecture follows common design patterns such as separation of concerns (different modules for authentication, user management, content management, etc.) and leverages middleware for tasks like logging and error handling.

*   **Scalability & Maintainability:**

    *   The RESTful API structure allows for easy expansion as additional endpoints or services are required.
    *   Utilizing cloud-based services (Firebase, Cloudinary, and third-party integrations) makes it simpler to scale horizontally with fluctuating loads.
    *   Code modularity and adherence to best practices in Node.js ensure that the system is maintainable and that updates or changes can be implemented with minimal disruption.

*   **Performance:**

    *   Caching strategies are applied where appropriate to reduce latency.
    *   Asynchronous programming and non-blocking APIs in Node.js help maintain high responsiveness, particularly during simultaneous requests.

## Database Management

*   **Technologies Used:**

    *   **Firebase Realtime Database:** Used for storing and syncing family posts, events, chats, and other live data.
    *   **NoSQL Structure:** Ideal for handling dynamic and hierarchical family data.

*   **Data Structure & Access:**

    *   Data is organized in collections/documents rather than traditional relational tables.
    *   Each data category (users, posts, chats, events, etc.) is stored as a collection, allowing for flexible data models that can evolve with the app's needs.
    *   The system leverages built-in Firebase security rules to control data access and ensure that only authorized users can read or modify data.

*   **Data Management Practices:**

    *   Regular backups and automated recovery procedures protect against data loss.
    *   Use of Firebase's real-time updates ensures that any changes are immediately visible to all connected clients.

## Database Schema

Although Firebase uses a NoSQL schema instead of fixed tables, the following outlines a human-readable organization of the data:

*   **Users Collection:**

    *   Stores user profiles including name, photo URL, birthday, email, and role (Family Circle Admin or User).
    *   Contains authentication information linked with Auth Clerk.

*   **Posts Collection:**

    *   Contains family feed posts with text content, images, or videos.
    *   Attributes include post ID, user ID, timestamp, content, and media URLs.

*   **Chats Collection:**

    *   Organized by chat sessions (direct messages and group chats).
    *   Each chat document includes an array of messages, each with sender ID, message content (with encryption details), timestamps, and any attached media.

*   **Events Collection:**

    *   Keeps event details such as event ID, title, description, dates, invited user IDs, RSVP status, and related event chat history.

*   **Tasks Collection (To-Do List):**

    *   Contains shared tasks including task ID, description, status (complete/pending), assigned family member, due date, and other metadata.

*   **Goals Collection:**

    *   Maintains records of family goals with progress updates, target details, and completion status.

*   **Directory Collection:**

    *   Stores contact details such as phone, email, and optional location data for each family member.

## API Design and Endpoints

*   **API Approach:**

    *   The backend uses RESTful API endpoints that allow the mobile app to communicate with the server seamlessly.
    *   Each endpoint is designed around a specific resource (like users, posts, events, etc.), facilitating clear and maintainable code.

*   **Key Endpoints:**

    *   **Authentication Endpoints:**

        *   /signup: For new user registration using email/password or Google accounts.
        *   /login: For user authentication using Auth Clerk.
        *   /forgot-password: To initiate password reset flows.

    *   **User Management Endpoints:**

        *   /user/profile: Fetch or update user profiles.
        *   /admin/invite: Manage family invites and role assignments.

    *   **Family Feed Endpoints:**

        *   /posts: Retrieve, create, update, or delete posts.
        *   /posts/like and /posts/comment: For interactions on posts.

    *   **Events Endpoints:**

        *   /events: Create, list, or update events.
        *   /events/rsvp: Manage event RSVPs and reminders.

    *   **Messaging Endpoints:**

        *   /chats: Manage direct messaging and group chat sessions.
        *   /chats/message: Send or retrieve messages, ensuring end-to-end encryption is maintained.

    *   **Other Endpoints:**

        *   /tasks: For managing shared to-do lists.
        *   /goals: For tracking and updating family goals.
        *   /contacts: For accessing the family directory.

## Hosting Solutions

*   **Cloud Providers & Environment:**

    *   The app leverages cloud hosting environments for both the Node.js REST APIs and Firebase services.
    *   **Firebase Hosting/Functions:** Used to deploy serverless Node.js functions and the realtime database, which reduces maintenance overhead and scales on-demand.

*   **Benefits:**

    *   **Reliability:** Cloud services like Firebase provide high uptime and redundancy.
    *   **Scalability:** Automatic scaling helps the backend accommodate varying loads with minimal manual intervention.
    *   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay-as-you-go models ensure that costs scale with usage, keeping expenses optimal during growth phases.

## Infrastructure Components

*   **Core Components:**

    *   **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming traffic evenly across server instances to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.

    *   **Caching Mechanisms:** Implemented at both the API level and using Firebase caching options to reduce database load and improve response times.

    *   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):**

        *   Used in conjunction with Firebase Hosting and Cloudinary to deliver static content (e.g., photos, videos) efficiently across the globe.

    *   **Third-Party Services:**

        *   **Cloudinary:** For media management and media storage, ensuring efficient image and video handling.
        *   **Stripe:** For secure payment processing.
        *   **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):** For push notifications, ensuring timely communication with users.

## Security Measures

*   **Authentication & Authorization:**

    *   Users sign in using Auth Clerk, ensuring secure handling of credentials.
    *   Access control is enforced based on user roles, such as Family Circle Admin and User.

*   **Data Encryption:**

    *   All messages are encrypted end-to-end, ensuring that only intended recipients can read them.
    *   HTTPS is enforced for all API endpoints to protect data in transit.

*   **Additional Security Practices:**

    *   Implementation of secure API tokens and session management.
    *   Regular security audits and compliance checks to adhere to data protection standards.
    *   File size restrictions for media uploads to prevent abuse and mitigate potential threats.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

*   **Monitoring Tools:**

    *   Firebase provides real-time monitoring and performance tracking, ensuring that any issues are immediately flagged for attention.
    *   Additional tools (such as logging libraries in Node.js, e.g., Winston) help track backend events and errors.
    *   Third-party services like Sentry may be integrated to catch and log runtime errors.

*   **Maintenance Strategies:**

    *   Automated deployment pipelines ensure that code updates and patches are smoothly rolled out.
    *   Regular backups and testing routines are in place to ensure data integrity and system reliability.
    *   Scheduled reviews and performance optimizations help keep the backend robust and responsive.
