# Family Circle App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first discovers Family Circle, they are welcomed by a stylish landing page that explains the purpose of the app and its use for keeping family connected. The first screen offers clear options to log in, sign up, or learn more. If the user is new, they can choose to sign up. During sign-up, they have the option to create their own Family Circle or join an existing one by entering a unique invite code, scanning a QR code, or following a special email link. Users can sign up using their email and password through Auth Clerk or choose the simpler method of signing in with Google credentials. Once authenticated, the application then directs the user to a fresh profile setup page where they are guided to add personal details such as their name, profile photo, birthday, and any other important personal information. If a user forgets their password, a Forgot Password flow is provided where they can request a secure reset, ensuring they regain access safely. Signing out is straightforward with a clearly labeled button, and users can re-enter through the login page using their chosen authentication method.

## Home Page

After signing in, all users land on the homepage, a central hub. The homepage includes a summary of recent family posts, upcoming events, and to-do tasks. It is built with an easy-to-navigate interface, where a bottom intuitive navigation bar allow users to jump quickly to pages like the Home, Calendar, Chats, and the ability to make a post. At the top of the page centered should be the Family Name 'The Smith Family Circle' for ex. and the user's profile pic circle on the top left that opens a panel that slides out from the left, and notification bell on the top right to show a bell with a badge number representing how many new notifications you have. For Family Circle Admins, there will be extra navigation on the slide out panel that provide additional tools such as managing pending invites, pairing and linking adult and child accounts, and handling permission settings. Regular users are greeted with their own focused summary, making it easy for them to remain updated with family activity.\

Below that is the date and under that Welcome Back, {firstname}!\
Under that profile circles of those that are in the circle, allow to scroll right. I'll provide a wireframe of the homepage.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The journey continues with a dynamic Family Feed that acts as the heartbeat of the app. Here, users can post updates, photos, videos, and thoughts about everyday family happenings. Once a post is shared, it appears immediately in the feed along with options to like or comment, promoting interaction. Tapping on a post will expand it to a detailed view where users see comments, likes, and the full post content. From the Family Feed, users can easily switch to the Messages page where both direct messages and group chats are available. Every message thread is designed to be secure with end-to-end encryption, and for special family events, each event has its own embedded chat so users can discuss details, media attachments, and logistics in one place. The admin will have the option to pin a post.

For event planning, users navigate to the Family Calendar page where all important dates such as birthdays, family gatherings, and special events are clearly marked. From this page, users can initiate the Event Creation flow. The event creation page is a simple form where users can choose a date, add details, invite family members, and even attach media if needed. Once an event is created, the screen transitions to an event detail page where the event chat, RSVP options, and reminders are accessible. The smooth navigation between these pages ensures that users never lose sight of their planning or communication activities.

The Media Sharing section is equally user-friendly. Family members can upload photos and videos to dedicated albums, with file size limits applied automatically (5 MB for photos and 50 MB for videos). The integration with a cloud service ensures that media files are optimized and delivered efficiently. Additionally, if users wish to share memories, they can easily transition from the media section to the Family Feed where they can tag posts or events with the shared media.

Task Management and goal tracking are woven into the everyday use of the app. On the dashboard, users will notice sections dedicated to shared to-do lists. Adult users, especially those with administrative privileges, can assign tasks such as chores or shopping list items to child accounts. Once a task is created, the process allows users to mark it as completed and view progress updates that can also be shared on the Family Feed, encouraging a sense of teamwork and celebration of goals met.

## Settings and Account Management

Every user has easy access to a dedicated Profile page where they can update their personal details, change their profile photo, or adjust privacy settings to control who can view their posts and personal information. Alongside the profile page is the Settings page, a centralized area where users can manage account preferences, notification settings, and more. Family Circle Admins have additional controls in this area, including the ability to approve new member invitations, adjust roles within the circle, and manage the family directory. The settings also cover subscription management where users who are opting for premium features can view and modify their subscription details, handle billing through Stripe, or make in-app purchases for additional storage or special customizations. After making changes in the settings, users can easily navigate back to the main dashboard, ensuring a seamless return to their primary interactions in the app.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Family Circle is designed to handle any missteps gracefully. If a user enters incorrect login details or a wrong invite code during the sign-up process, clear and simple error messages appear, providing guidance on how to fix the mistakes. In cases where there is a lost network connection or the backend services are temporarily down, the app presents a friendly downtime message that explains the issue while guiding the user to retry later. If users attempt actions which they are not permitted to perform, for instance if a regular user tries to access admin-only functions, the system displays a polite alert and redirects them to the correct page where they only see allowed features. Additionally, during the media upload process, if a file exceeds the set limits or is in an unacceptable format, the system informs the user immediately and provides specific instructions to correct the error, ensuring that the overall flow remains uninterrupted.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a user first lands on the Family Circle app, they are taken through a thoughtful and secure process of onboarding, authentication, and personal profile setup. Once inside the app, the intuitive dashboard provides a hub of activities ranging from family feed posts to to-do lists and event management. All core features such as messaging, media sharing, event creation, and task assignments are tightly integrated, ensuring every interaction is connected and user friendly. For both Family Circle Admins and regular users, the app provides robust tools to manage family connections, stay updated on events, and maintain an ongoing dialogue with one another. By combining seamless navigation with real-time updates, clear settings customization, and graceful error handling, Family Circle supports an engaging, secure, and comprehensive family management experience on both iOS and Android platforms.
