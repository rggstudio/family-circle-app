12. Create a Profile/Settings screen at `/src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx` for managing personal details, privacy options, and notification preferences. (Reference: App Flow: Profile/Settings)
13. Implement navigation using React Navigation by setting up `/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` with stack and tab navigators. (Reference: Technical Stack: React Native)
14. Create API services in `/src/services/api.ts` to handle REST API calls to the backend for authentication, posts, events, messaging, tasks, and payments. (Reference: App Flow, Technical Stack)
15. Style all screens to match the provided color scheme (Black, Oxford Blue, Orange Web, Platinum, White) using SCSS or styled-components. (Reference: Key Requirements: Design)
16. **Validation**: Run the Expo app on both iOS and Android simulators to navigate through onboarding, dashboard, and feature screens without errors.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  Create a `/backend` directory for the Node.js server code. (Reference: Technical Stack: Backend)
2.  Initialize the Node.js project in `/backend` with `npm init -y`. (Reference: Technical Stack: Node.js)
3.  Set up an Express server in `/backend/app.js` to handle RESTful API endpoints. (Reference: App Flow)
4.  Integrate Firebase Admin SDK in `/backend/firebase.js` to interact with the Firebase real-time database, messaging, and authentication services. (Reference: Technical Stack: Firebase)
5.  Implement authentication endpoints (`POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/auth/register`) in `/backend/routes/auth.js` using Auth Clerk integration. (Reference: Key Requirements: Authentication)
6.  Create endpoints for Family Feed posts in `/backend/routes/feed.js` (GET and POST endpoints). (Reference: Key Requirements: Family Feed)
7.  Build endpoints for Calendar events at `/backend/routes/calendar.js` (GET and POST endpoints) with Google Calendar API integration hooks. (Reference: Key Requirements: Calendar)
8.  Develop messaging endpoints in `/backend/routes/messages.js` (GET and POST endpoints) with provisions for end-to-end encryption. (Reference: Key Requirements: Messaging)
9.  Add file upload endpoints in `/backend/routes/media.js` enforcing file size limits (5MB for photos, 50MB for videos) and integrate Cloudinary. (Reference: Key Requirements: Media Sharing)
10. Implement Task Management endpoints in `/backend/routes/tasks.js` (GET and POST endpoints) to facilitate shared to-do lists and assignments. (Reference: Key Requirements: Task Management)
11. Set up the Family Directory endpoint in `/backend/routes/directory.js` for GET requests returning contact details. (Reference: Key Requirements: Family Directory)
12. Develop Payment Processing endpoints in `/backend/routes/payments.js` to handle Stripe-based subscriptions and in-app purchases, including webhook handling. (Reference: Key Requirements: Payment Processing)
13. Apply security measures in all endpoints, including HTTPS enforcement and libraries for end-to-end encryption in messaging. (Reference: Key Requirements: Security)
14. **Validation**: Use Postman or automated tests (e.g., Jest with Supertest) to ensure all API endpoints return expected responses and enforce file size limits.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  Connect frontend API calls in `/src/services/api.ts` to the corresponding backend endpoints. (Reference: App Flow: Integration)
2.  Integrate Auth Clerk authentication in the frontend screens so that sign-up, login, and invite flows communicate correctly with the backend. (Reference: Key Requirements: Authentication)
3.  Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging by adding FCM configuration in the mobile app and backend notifications setup in `/backend/firebase.js`. (Reference: Key Requirements: Push Notifications)
4.  Integrate Google Calendar API in the Calendar screen so users can sync events stored in the backend with their calendar. (Reference: Key Requirements: Calendar)
5.  Integrate Google Contacts API in the Family Directory screen to optionally sync contacts if required. (Reference: Key Requirements: Family Directory)
6.  Ensure Cloudinary configuration is correctly applied in the media upload endpoint so media files are managed externally. (Reference: Key Requirements: Media Sharing)
7.  Connect the Stripe payment endpoints with the frontend payment flows, ensuring secure handling of subscriptions and in-app purchases. (Reference: Key Requirements: Payment Processing)
8.  **Validation**: Run integration tests to confirm end-to-end communication between frontend services and backend APIs using Expo device logs and backend logs.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Deploy the backend Node.js server to a cloud provider (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or GCP App Engine) and configure environment variables. (Reference: Technical Stack: Backend)
2.  Set up Firebase production configuration by applying appropriate database rules and enabling Firebase Cloud Messaging in the Firebase console. (Reference: Technical Stack: Firebase)
3.  Configure Auth Clerk credentials and environment settings in the production environment for secure authentication. (Reference: Key Requirements: Authentication)
4.  Configure Cloudinary and Stripe production API keys in the deployed backend environment. (Reference: Key Requirements: Media Sharing, Payment Processing)
5.  Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for both the mobile app and backend server to automate tests and deployments. (Reference: IDE/Tools: Cursor)
6.  Build and package the mobile app for iOS and Android using Expo build commands (`expo build:ios` and `expo build:android`). (Reference: App Flow: Onboarding)
7.  **Validation**: Conduct full end-to-end tests covering user sign-up, posting, media upload, messaging, and payment processing on the deployed environment to ensure all features function as expected. (Reference: Q&A: Pre-Launch Checklist)
