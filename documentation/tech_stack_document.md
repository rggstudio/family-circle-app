# Family Circle Tech Stack Document

This document explains all the building blocks of the Family Circle app in everyday language. It is aimed at anyone interested, regardless of a technical background. Below, you’ll find an overview of our choices for building this mobile application that helps families stay connected through posts, events, chats, and more.

## Frontend Technologies

For the part of the app that users interact with directly, we have chosen modern and flexible tools:

*   **Expo**: A platform that simplifies building mobile apps for both iOS and Android using React Native. It keeps the development process smooth and makes our app feel native on both platforms.
*   **Typescript**: A reliable programming language that adds clarity and security to the code, reducing errors and making our app more stable.
*   **React Native Components and Styling**: We follow modern styling standards (using CSS and SCSS) with a set of defined colors and gradients. This ensures a consistent and visually appealing interface, making it easy for families to navigate and interact.

## Backend Technologies

Behind the scenes, our app relies on several systems to keep everything running reliably and securely:

*   **Firebase**:

    *   Serves as our real-time database and also handles messaging and notifications seamlessly.
    *   Provides essential services such as data storage and real-time updates, important for features like live chat and event notifications.

*   **Node.js**: Acts as the server framework that processes API requests and coordinates data between the app and the backend systems. It supports our RESTful API approach.

*   **Auth Clerk**: Powers our authentication system, allowing users to sign up, log in authentication to access the app safely.

*   **Third-Party APIs**:

    *   **Google Calendar API**: Helps in integrating and syncing family events and reminders.
    *   **Google Contacts API**: Assists in managing family directory information effortlessly.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

We have designed our infrastructure to support a secure, scalable, and easy-to-deploy app:

*   **Cloud Hosting & Expo Deployment**: Our mobile app is built using Expo, which simplifies deploying to both iOS and Android. The cloud-hosted backend ensures that the app remains available even as we grow.

*   **CI/CD Pipelines & Version Control**:

    *   We use version control systems (like Git) to manage code changes and collaboration among developers.
    *   Continuous Integration/Delivery practices help us roll out updates safely and efficiently.

*   **Advanced Tools**:

    *   **Cursor**: An advanced IDE that offers real-time code suggestions to make development faster and error-free.
    *   **Claude**: An intelligent assistant that helps refine and optimize our code, ensuring best practices are followed.

## Third-Party Integrations

To enhance functionality and ensure a smooth user experience, Family Circle leverages several third-party services:

*   **Cloudinary**: Manages media uploads and storage. It automatically optimizes photos and videos (with set limits such as 5 MB for images and 50 MB for videos) so that media loads quickly and efficiently.
*   **Stripe**: Handles all payment processing, including subscriptions, in-app purchases, and premium feature access. Its integration ensures transactions are secure and user-friendly.
*   **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: Provides push notifications for alerts such as new messages or event reminders, delivering timely updates across mobile devices.
*   **Google Calendar & Contacts APIs**: Allow the app to integrate with external scheduling and contact management services, enhancing event planning and family directory features.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Keeping our users and their data secure is our top priority. Here are some key aspects:

*   **End-to-End Encryption**: All chat and messaging features employ encryption to ensure that conversations remain private and only accessible to the intended users.
*   **Authentication & Access Control**: With Auth Clerk, we ensure that signing in is secure and reliable, while role-specific permissions (like Family Circle Admin vs. regular User) keep sensitive controls in the right hands.
*   **Media Management**: By enforcing file size limits (5 MB for photos, 50 MB for videos) and using Cloudinary, we balance media quality, performance, and storage costs.
*   **Optimized Infrastructure**: Regular performance optimizations, version control, and CI/CD pipelines contribute to a responsive, stable app experience.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In summary, the Tech Stack for the Family Circle app has been carefully chosen to meet the app’s goal of connecting families in a secure, engaging, and efficient way:

*   **Frontend**: Expo, Typescript, and modern styling for a native cross-platform experience.
*   **Backend**: Firebase for real-time data and messaging, combined with a Node.js server to manage API requests and integrations with Auth Clerk, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts.
*   **Infrastructure**: Cloud-hosted services with CI/CD pipelines ensure reliability and easy updates, supported by advanced coding assistants like Cursor and Claude.
*   **Third-Party Integrations**: Cloudinary optimizes media handling, Stripe secures payments, and Firebase Cloud Messaging maintains a steady stream of notifications.
*   **Security & Performance**: End-to-end encryption, strict media guidelines, and robust authentication measures all contribute to a secure and fast user experience.

These technology choices have been made with family connection in mind—ensuring a user-friendly, reliable, and secure platform that fosters communication and shared experiences for every family using Family Circle.
